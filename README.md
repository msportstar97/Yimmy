# Yimmy
Yimmy is a web app catered towards college students, 
mainly living in apartments, and eating out as a daily habit. 
Often times, these students are eating the same unhealthy foods from the same restaurants everyday. 
Yimmy will provide more variety and healthier options for the week that are both nearby and meet their dietary needs and preferences.

Yimmy allows a user to create an account and input their health information. 
Once the user logs in, they can edit preferences, search for meal options, 
or view their personal meal plans. In the search page, Yimmy offers two options to the user: 
the user can search for their preferred meal options from nearby restaurants depending on the parameters
they choose and keywords they put in, or Yimmy can generate a personalized weekly meal plan for the user 
given the parameters and the keywords. Yimmy can also provide a visualization of the nutritional breakdown for
the user's entire meal plan.
